* As an admin, I can schedule a list of posts to a channel so that they can be uploaded automatically.
 * Channel means a Facebook page or twitter account. 
* As an admin, I can set interval for each channel so that new post will be updated to each channel after the interval.
* As an admin, I can set tags for each channel so that they will be appended to text. 
 * As for Twitter, 140 letter limit should be taken into account.
